# Portfolio
*This repository contains various projects I have worked on as part of my learning journey in Python and others. The projects are organized into folders based on their type and complexity.*

# **C#**
This folder contains projects and exercises in C# that demonstrate my understanding of the language. It includes basic applications, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, and more advanced topics as I continue to expand my knowledge and experience in C# development.

# Python 

### **Simple Apps**
This folder contains small, self-contained Python applications that focus on basic functionality and problem-solving. These apps are designed to demonstrate my ability to write simple, efficient code to solve common programming challenges.

### **OOP**
This project demonstrates my understanding of object-oriented programming in Python. It includes a simple app that showcases the principles of OOP, such as classes, inheritance, and polymorphism.
