This repository contains various projects I have worked on as part of my learning journey in Python and others. The projects are organized into folders based on their type and complexity.

# Python 

### **Simple Apps**
This folder contains small, self-contained Python applications that focus on basic functionality and problem-solving. These apps are designed to demonstrate my ability to write simple, efficient code to solve common programming challenges.

### **OOP**
This project demonstrates my understanding of object-oriented programming in Python. It includes a simple app that showcases the principles of OOP, such as classes, inheritance, and polymorphism.
